# Server.js
First I initialised to the port 7000 and listen.
I have 3 end points playerName, startGame, and enterGuess
Game starts by entering the player name.
Then startGame would select the random Word and displays with underscore.
Afterwards player would enter their selection letter. 
If they select all letters correct they will win!! if not they will lose!!
